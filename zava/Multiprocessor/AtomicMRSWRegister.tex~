\section{\textbf{Atomic MRSW Register}}


\subsection{Particular Case}
\par
The characteristics of this type of register are:
\begin{itemize}
\item It should never happen that $R^{i} \rightarrow W^{i}$
\item It should never happen that for any ${j}$, ${W^{i} \rightarrow W^{j} \rightarrow R^{j}}$
\item If ${R^{i} \rightarrow R^{j}}$ then ${i \leq j}$
\end{itemize}
The book proposes to do this by using multiple SRSW registers.

\subsection{Solution}
The algorithm then requires a 2 dimensional table. When a writer decides to update the register, it has to update the values in cells $A[i][i]$, where $i$ is the thread id. Apart from writing the value, it has to also update the cell with a timestamp. 
\par
In the other hand, when a reader wants to read from the register, it checks the timestamp of the cell $A[i][i]$. After that, it has to check other cells in the same column (ie, cells $A[x][i]$) to see if there has been an update in between. That is done by comparing the timestamps. If there is a newer timestamp, the reader has then to update all cells in its row (ie $A[i][x]$). This is the way to indicate subsequent readers which version of the value has the previous reader retrieved.
\par
It is easy to see that the first property is satisfied because there is no way to read a future value. In order to read a value, this value has to be written before.
\par
The second property is also satisfied because when a reader reads the value, it reads the one with the most recent timestamp by scaning the timestamps in its corresponding column. This reader also helps subsequent readers by updating all cells in its row. Forcing property 3 to be satisfied as well.
\par
The two test cases presented demonstrates the same as previous examples. It would have been great to also have test cases that demonstrate that this particular register satisfies property 3.
