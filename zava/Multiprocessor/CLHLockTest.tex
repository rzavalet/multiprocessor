\section{\textbf{CLH Queue Lock}}
\subsection{Particular Case}
\par
Using queue locks solve two problems that appear in simpler locking protocols. Firstly, by using a queue, cache-coherence traffic is reduced because each thread spin on a different memory location; and secondly, by using a queue, threads can know whether their turn has come by inspecting the status of their predecesor in the queue.
\par
The particular case that we want to study in this experiment is \textit{How can we implemente a space efficient Queue Lock?}
\par
\subsection{Solution}
\par
One solution for this problem is given by the CLHLock protocol. The algorithm that implement this protocol need two fields local to the thread: A pointer to the current node and a pointer to the previous node. The queue is constructed by having the pointer \textit{previous} pointing to the previous node's \textit{current} field. This field contains a boolean value which is false when the thread releases the lock. When this is the case, the next thread is allowed to acquire the lock. 
\par
\subsection{Experiment Description}
\par
To demonstrate that this implementation works, the test that was provided does the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Initiate a shared counter with a value of $0$
\item Start $8$ threads
\item Each thread has to increment the counter by one $1024$ times
\item At the end, the counter must hold a value of $8*1024$
\end{enumerate}
\par
These are the details of the system we used to run the experiments:
\begin{itemize}
\item Processor: Intel Core i5 @2.5 GHz. 2 Cores.
\item L2 Cache per Core: 256 KB
\item L3 Cache: 3 MB
\item System Memory: 16 GB
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Sample Results}
\par
For this test, we saw that in every try, it always passed.

\subsection{Interpretation}
It was shown that the algorithm seems to work and allows synchronization of Multiple threads trying to access a shared variable.
\par
One important thing about this algorith is that threads spin checking for different memory addresses which avoids invalidation of cached copies. Another important advantage is that it requieres a limited number of memory and also provides first-in-first-out fairness. 
\par
The case were this algorithm is not good is when, in a NUMA architecture, the \textit{previous} pointer points to a remote location. In that case, the performance of the algorithm degradates.
