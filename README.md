# multiprocessor
In 2016, Dario, Isai and I were enrolled in the course "Multiprocessor Programming," lectured by Prof. Isaac D. Scherson, from the University of California, Irvine. Throughout the course, we had to review, analyze, test, and correct the programming exercises described in the book "The Art of Multiprocessor Programming" by Herlihy and Shavit. The final project consisted of documenting all of our observations. 

This repository contains the final document and the latex source.
