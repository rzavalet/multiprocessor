\section{Problem Definition}
The concept of Spin Lock comes from the following problem: \textit{In the case where a thread tries to adquire a lock on a resource and it fails, what should be done?}
\par
There are at least to ways to react to this problem:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Keep trying getting the lock. In this case the lock is called a Spin Lock. The thread is then said to be in a busy wait.
\item Suspend the execution of the current thread and let the others do some work. This action is called \textit{blocking}
\end{enumerate}
\par
In this chapter we will study different ways in which spin locks can be implemented.
