\section{\textbf{StripedCuckooHashSetTest}}

\subsection{Particular Case (problem)}
The problem we try to solve is that of concurrent hashing, when we use
the hash to implement a set data structure.

\subsection{Solution}
This solution is a refinement of the cuckoo technique we mentioned for
other solutions like \C{CoarseCuckooHashSetTest}; providing a matrix
of reentrant locks, where each cell protects a cell on the hash
table. The following constructor shows how the locks are initialized: \\

\begin{lstlisting}[style=numbers]
  public StripedCuckooHashSet(int capacity) {
    super(capacity);
    lock  = new ReentrantLock[2][capacity];
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < capacity; j++) {
        lock[i][j] = new ReentrantLock();
      }
    }
  }
\end{lstlisting}
\hfill

This solution extends the solution named \C{PhasedCuckooHashSet}. Part
of its main differences are the \C{acquire} and \C{release} methods;
which follow certain order on the locks associated to items, in
order to avoid deadlocks: \\

\begin{lstlisting}[style=numbers]
  public final void acquire(T x) {
    Lock lock0 = lock[0][hash0(x) % lock[0].length];
    Lock lock1 = lock[1][hash1(x) % lock[1].length];
    lock0.lock();
    lock1.lock();
  }

  public final void release(T x) {
    Lock lock0 = lock[0][hash0(x) % lock[0].length];
    Lock lock1 = lock[1][hash1(x) % lock[1].length];
    lock0.unlock();
    lock1.unlock();
    }
\end{lstlisting}
\hfill
    
\subsection{Experiment Description}
The test is in essence the same as that described for
\C{CoarseCuckooHashSetTest}, with some small differences: among them,
the most relevant is the
remover thread class used in \C{testParallelBoth}, which does not fail
anymore if the element it tried to remove was not present; it only
increments a counter of missed deletions. This minor change prevents
the test from failing like the others.

\subsection{Observations and Interpretations}
The test runs fine in 2 and 24 cores, without any assertion error;
below a sample execution: \\

\begin{verbatim}
[oraadm@gdlaa008 orig]$ junit hash.StripedCuckooHashSetTest
.sequential add, contains, and remove
.parallel both
.parallel add
.parallel remove

Time: 0.017

OK (4 tests)
\end{verbatim}
